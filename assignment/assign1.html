    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>

    <h2>Travelling Around the World</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Travelling</b> is my favorite hobby because it allows me to explore new places, meet different people, and experience diverse cultures. Whenever I visit a new location, I feel a sense of excitement and adventure. <i>It gives me a break from the usual routine</i> and helps me recharge mentally.
        <br><br>
        I enjoy visiting historical sites, natural landscapes, and trying local food. <u>Every journey teaches me something new</u> — whether it's about a place's history, its people, or even about myself. Travelling opens the mind and broadens perspective.
